    <h1>Internet History</h1>
<p>The importance of the Internet Archive cannot be overstated and it has been difficult to watch them struggle this last month.</p>
<p>You expect people to go after big business and companies with high-dollar-value data, not a library.</p>
<p>&quot;The internet is forever&quot; has been repeated for a long time. While the intended message - to encourage caution in what we do or say or upload to the internet - is an important message I think it has also had a side-effect in how we view the internet and &quot;history.&quot; It takes a lot of work to preserve things and data is no different. Technologies change over time.</p>
<p>The history that is actually being preserved is still fragile. It's easy to forget but the internet is just a bunch of cables running around the world. The Library of Alexandria could still be burned today, even if everything was stored on hard-drives and backed up to the cloud.</p>
<p>Also, to quote Kenneth Goldsmith: &quot;If you love something, download it!&quot;</p>
