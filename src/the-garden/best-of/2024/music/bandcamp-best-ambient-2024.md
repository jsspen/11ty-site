# Bandcamp's Best Ambient Music of 2024

[The Best Ambient Music of 2024 | Bandcamp Daily](https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2024/the-best-ambient-music-of-2024)
"As someone who has spent the last three years closely surveying ambient’s dense topography, it has been fascinating to observe the genre’s rapid, but subtle evolution. When I began writing this column at the start of 2022, the popularity of atmospheric music was at a fever pitch, as wellness culture latched onto the so-called “healing qualities” of ambient in the wake of pandemic trauma.

The world has only become more complicated and turbulent since then, but ambient’s mainstream appeal has slightly dwindled. Yet it is increasingly ambitious upon its return to the shadows, entering a bold, amorphous chapter. Over my past 18-or-so months immersed in ambient, it has led me to Brooklyn dancefloors; smokey German warehouses; secretive industrial venues; muddy Revolutionary War bunkers; and beyond—stimulating, sometimes unnerving zones, far removed from the sterile confines of meditation centers and treatment clinics.

As I reflect on another period of jam-packed listening, I cannot quite locate the words to accurately summarize the broad condition of ambient right now. That is exactly how I can tell it is in an exciting place. From Dialect to Slowfoam to Buttechno, here are a handful of ambient-leaning albums that stuck with me throughout an intense, albeit musically fruitful 2024." – Ted Davis
- [ ] [Atlas of Green | Dialect](https://dialect-trax.bandcamp.com/album/atlas-of-green)
	- **TD:** "Many of the best instrumental compositions possess an ability to transport. Andrew PM Hunt’s latest record as [Dialect](https://dialect-trax.bandcamp.com/music), _Atlas Of Green__,_ rises to this task. Released by [RVNG Intl.](https://daily.bandcamp.com/label-profile/rvng-label-guide-bandcamp), the album envisions the life of a musician named Green, who is operating against the backdrop of a plausible near future, in which flora and fauna mingle with technological relics from a toppled civilization. On these 12 tracks, earthy strums rise from synthesized soil, like lavender growing out of stone. In a societal moment marked by overwhelming uncertainty, _Atlas Of Green_ confronts themes of dystopia while radiating hopefulness."
- [x] [The Butterfly Drinks The Tears Of The Tortoise | CS + Kreme | The Trilogy Tapes](https://thetrilogytapes.bandcamp.com/album/the-butterfly-drinks-the-tears-of-the-tortoise)
	- **TD:** "It’s difficult to classify [CS + Kreme](https://csandkreme.bandcamp.com/music)—a trait that works to the project’s advantage. The Melbourne-based duo of Conrad Standish and Sam Karmel is just as likely to dole out dubby murk as they are to offer a melancholy guitar sketch. Their latest album for British label and streetwear brand [The Trilogy Tapes](https://thetrilogytapes.bandcamp.com/), _The Butterfly_ _Drinks The_ _Tears Of The Tortoise__,_ highlights their range. Across eight pieces, prickly billows and bulging minimal grooves inject modernity into murmuring folk arrangements. _The Butterfly Drinks The Tears Of The Tortoise_ wanders in and out of focus, the whole thing seemingly engulfed by tendrils of gray smog."
	- Also one of my favorites of the year.
- [ ] [lacuna and parlor | more eaze](https://moreeaze.bandcamp.com/album/lacuna-and-parlor)
	- **TD:** "Mari Maurice (aka [more eaze](https://moreeaze.bandcamp.com/)) has gradually but persistently climbed to the forefront of the New York City indie scene. The Austin, Texas transplant debuted as a solo artist in the 2010s, prolifically releasing material and performing in tandem with [Claire Rousay](https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/claire-rousay-sentiment-review), [Lomelda](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/lomelda-interview), and many others. In 2024, Maurice expanded further, exploring [dismantled Americana](https://ooh-sounds.bandcamp.com/album/more-eaze-pardo-glass-paris-paris-texas-texas), [harsh post-rock](https://waterdamage12xu.bandcamp.com/album/in-e), and [computerized noise](https://moreeaze.bandcamp.com/album/night-of-fire). The mellowest of her efforts was the more eaze album _lacuna and parlor__,_ which arrived via reliably solid Polish label [Mondoj](https://mondoj.bandcamp.com/). Whispers of chamber music and incidental recordings turn up across these seven tracks. Bowed swells and trembling slide guitar hover atop elongated chord progressions. For as scholastic as what lies beneath the surface is, the thing that makes _lacuna and parlor_ shine is its coziness. It conjures the enveloping woodiness of a cedar cigar box, stuffed with incense instead of tobacco."
- [x] [Endlessness | Nala Sinephro](https://nalasinephro.bandcamp.com/album/endlessness)
	- **TD:** "London’s underground is in a healthy state. _Endlessness__—_the entrancing sophomore album from [Nala Sinephro](https://nalasinephro.bandcamp.com/album/endlessness)—is a testament to the UK city’s communal inventiveness. The album is an interwoven suite, carried by a repeated arpeggio that’s passed between players. _Endlessness_ features contributions from celebrated bandleader [Nubya Garcia](https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/nubya-garcia-odyssey-review), [black midi](https://bmblackmidi.bandcamp.com/music) drummer Morgan Simpson, [Ezra Collective](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/ezra-collective-you-cant-steal-my-joy-interview)’s James Mollison, and others. This hodgepodge of guests enable the chic blend of synthesis, harping, and featherweight orchestration that Sinephro has honed to traverse cosmic summits and aqueous valleys. _Endlessness_ makes me imagine what might have happened if [kindred harp innovators](https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/jazz-harp-list) like [Alice Coltrane](https://alicecoltrane.bandcamp.com/album/world-sprituality-classics-1-the-ecstatic-music-of-alice-coltrane-turiyasangitananda) or [Dorothy Ashby](https://jazzdispensary.bandcamp.com/album/hip-harp-japan) had recorded for Sinephro’s label [Warp](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/warp-records-comes-to-bandcamp)."
	- Also one of my favorites of the year.
- [ ] [Dew Point Harmonics | Luke Sanger](https://lukesanger.bandcamp.com/album/dew-point-harmonics)
	- **TD:** "It is hardly shocking that a label run by seasoned electronic music journalist [Philip Sherburne](https://daily.bandcamp.com/contributors/philip-sherburne) and [Lapsus](https://lapsus.bandcamp.com/) founder Albert Salinas would quickly become one of the greatest ambient resources going. Launched in 2021, [Balmat](https://balmat.bandcamp.com/) has established a bookish lane with records from [Patricia Wolf](https://patriciawolf.bandcamp.com/), [Hoavi](https://gostzvuk.bandcamp.com/album/phases), and [nueen](https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/iceboy-violet-nueen-you-said-youd-hold-my-hand-through-the-fire-review). The imprint maintained its stride this year, with burbling albums by [Coral Morphologic and Nick León](https://balmat.bandcamp.com/album/projections-of-a-coral-city), [Panoram](https://panoram.bandcamp.com/), [Bartosz Kruczyński](https://earthtraxonline.bandcamp.com/album/dreams-whispers?label=4237811226), [Luke Wyland](https://lukewyland.bandcamp.com/), and [Luke Sanger](https://lukesanger.bandcamp.com/). Sanger’s _Dew Point Harmonics_ firmly captured my attention due to its pairing of dissonance and naturalism. Shaped by one-of-a-kind software, pretty melodies are woven together over coarse rustles and atonal timbres. The 13 pieces on _Dew Point Harmonics_ are the result of solitary hikes on the English coast. While they were generated using modules and algorithms, they exude a deceptively human spontaneity."
	- Love the artwork from José Quintanar, someone I've been following as part of a small number of artists working in what I guess I'll call "formalist comics."
- [x] [Natur | KMRU](https://kmru.bandcamp.com/album/natur)
	- **TD:** "Joseph Kamaru, who records as [KMRU](https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/kmru-discography-list), has quickly ascended to the foreground of the avant-garde, thanks to both his academic methods and conceptual approach. He continued to roll out albums at a steady clip this year, one of which was [a notable collaboration](https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/krm-kmru-disconnect-review) with [The Bug](https://thebugmusic.bandcamp.com/)’s [Kevin Richard Martin](https://daily.bandcamp.com/big-ups/big-ups-kevin-richard-martin-the-bug). But my favorite KMRU of the year was _Natur__._ The 52-minute track is an homage to the stillness of his adopted home in Berlin, contrasting it with the bustle of his native Nairobi. A grainy hum, peppered with skittering field recordings, shifts from a sharp rattle to a fathomless void. Tweaked over tour dates alongside [Fennesz](https://fenneszemego.bandcamp.com/music), _Natur_ emphasizes KMRU’s dynamic simplicity."
	- It's a nice record like all of the rest of the KMRU albums I've heard but it still doesn't really hit the right spot for me. Something about his production style just doesn't connect with me. It's probably my favorite that I've heard from him, though!
- [ ] [Drifts and Surfaces | Elori Saxl](https://elorisaxl.bandcamp.com/album/drifts-and-surfaces)
	- **TD:** "Over the last few years, forward-thinking composer [Elori Saxl](https://elorisaxl.bandcamp.com/music) has drifted between New York City and Wisconsin. Her Guggenheim-supported release for [Western Vinyl](https://westernvinyl.bandcamp.com/), _Drifts and Surfaces__,_ is inspired by stints on Madeline Island, Wisconsin during Covid-19 lockdowns. Existence on the small settlement in Lake Superior led Saxl to ruminate on the intersection of physical and digital realities. The three faltering pieces on _Drifts and Surfaces_ have a distinctly Midwestern aura, evoking a frigid beachside terrain with windswept drones on processed acoustic instruments. Appearances from the [Third Coast Percussion](https://thirdcoastpercussion.bandcamp.com/album/currents-volume-3) and [Tigue](https://tigue.bandcamp.com/album/strange-paradise) drum ensembles add to _Drifts and Surfaces_’s inward-gazing glow."
- [x] [Jazz Plates | Perila and Ulla | perila](https://perilazone.bandcamp.com/album/jazz-plates-2)
	- **TD:** "Frequent collaborators [Ulla Straus](https://ullastraus.bandcamp.com/music) and Aleksandra Zakharenko (aka [Perila](https://perilazone.bandcamp.com/)) marry trendiness and technicality. For as bloopy and withdrawn as their respective work can be, they’re also heavily influenced by jazz. _Jazz Plates__—_the pair’s aptly-titled partnership for Barcelona’s [Paralaxe Editions](https://paralaxe-editions.bandcamp.com/)—is the result of the duo recording together IRL for the first time. The end result is freewheeling and springy, calling to mind jasmine wafting on summer breeze. Since this album dropped in September, I’ve been hung up all over again on Ulla’s excellent 2022 album [_Foam_](https://ullastraus.bandcamp.com/album/foam-2)_—_an instant addition to the pantheon of classic glitch records. _Jazz Plates_ pulls from a similar palette, but reframes it in immediate, organic ways."
- [ ] [Pastoral Stills From Every Age | Liai](https://liai.bandcamp.com/album/pastoral-stills-from-every-age)
	- **TD:** "As is the case for many people who work on the creative side of music, I don numerous hats in my daily grind. Away from journalism, I frequently DJ and book events around New York City. One of the better decisions that I made this year was cold-emailing Lo Bise (aka [Liai](https://liai.bandcamp.com/album/pastoral-stills-from-every-age?logged_in_menubar=true&search_item_id=2189682655&search_item_type=b&search_match_part=%3F&search_page_id=3844866315&search_page_no=0&search_rank=1)) to ask if they would play at a psychedelic loft show I co-ordinated. Their set that night was strikingly nuanced, made spellbinding by bubbling vocal snippets and beds of glacial texture. It reinforced my infatuation with their April album, _Pastoral Stills From Every Age,_ which recalls a hypothetical video game soundtrack or the ‘90s output of [Oval](https://daily.bandcamp.com/lists/oval-album-guide). Liai dwells adjacent to the club, not club realm, while also building a singular, lush microhabitat."
- [ ] [Transcorporeal Portal | Slowfoam | Somewhere Press](https://somewherepress.bandcamp.com/album/transcorporeal-portal)
	- **TD:** "Over the course of the last few years, the chillout room has been resurrected. The decompression space was a staple at ‘90s raves, but largely disappeared from consciousness at the turn of the century. Due to the emergence of queer lounges like [Kwia](https://ra.co/features/4278) in Berlin and parties like [Osmosis](https://osmosisinthetrees.com/) in Oregon, public relaxation and formless electronics are once again being reunited in interesting ways. Near the heart of this movement is Madelyn Byrd (aka [Slowfoam](https://slowfoam.bandcamp.com/music)), a Berlin-based artist originally from the United States. Their March full-length for [Somewhere Press](https://somewherepress.bandcamp.com/music), _Transcorporeal Portal__,_ utilizes thumping percussion, deep pads, and manipulated acoustics to ponder gender and ecology. Masterfully twisting familiar timbres into baffling structures, _Transcorporeal Portal’s_ universe is mirrored, yet brambly. Byrd’s prior releases for [Jungle Gym Records](https://junglegymrecords.bandcamp.com/) and [Mappa](https://daily.bandcamp.com/label-profile/slovakian-label-mappa-editions) hinted at their knack for wordlessly tackling cerebral subject matter. _Transcorporeal Portal_ takes things to the next level, enhanced by Byrd’s virtuosic aural design."
- [ ] [lost sounds | buttechno](https://buttechno.bandcamp.com/album/lost-sounds)
	- **TD:** "Berlin-based DJ and producer [Pavel Milyakov](https://buttechno.bandcamp.com/music) typically releases his aloof outings eponymously; he employs his alias Buttechno for livelier cuts, which have landed on the labels like [Kalahari Oyster Cult](https://kalaharioystercult.bandcamp.com/), [Incienso](https://inciensorecs.bandcamp.com/), and others. March’s unjustly overlooked Buttechno album, [_Lost Sounds_](https://buttechno.bandcamp.com/album/lost-sounds)_,_ channels a barren wintriness that reminds me of latter-day [Burial](https://daily.bandcamp.com/album-of-the-day/burial-antidawn-review). Frosty pads splash oceanic strokes on a bleak canvas of crackles and hisses. Occasionally, vague breakbeats and 2-step rhythms push into eclectic, driving territory. Even at these pummeling crests, _Lost Sounds_ is remarkably introspective—a record I have kept returning to on hushed nocturnal walks."
- [ ] [Memory Empathy | DJ Birdbath | Theory Therapy](https://theorytherapy.bandcamp.com/album/memory-empathy)
	- **TD:** "On paper, the idea of an ambient release serving as an incitement to motion seems somewhat contradictory. But—in a 2024 defined by boundary destruction—[DJ Birdbath](https://djbirdbath.bandcamp.com/)’s _Memory Empathy_ toed the line between propulsion and airiness exceptionally well. The album arrived via Australian label and mix series [Theory Therapy](https://theorytherapy.bandcamp.com/), and fuses dubby chords, woozy samples, and downcast grooves. The majority of the record is suited for glazed-eyed discombobulation, but its energetic peaks are particularly gripping. Disassembled jungle opener “Kitsch Memory” embodies this essence, begging to score bouts of euphoria and fluttery anxiety in equal measure. _Memory Empathy_ offers many such examples of bleary beat-making at its most emotive and bittersweet."
