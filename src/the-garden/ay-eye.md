[Meet Sauron, a new home-security system for the terrified tech elite](https://archive.is/0ZBHr) (Nitasha Tiku, The Washington Post, 2024/12/05)

"By incorporating drones, facial recognition and high-tech sensors, the company aims to super-charge home security, part of Silicon Valley’s push to ease growing anxiety over safety."

"Cameras and sensors surveil the perimeter, scanning bystanders’ faces for potential threats. Drones from a “deterrence pod” scare off trespassers by projecting a search light over any suspicious movements. A virtual view of the home is rendered in 3D and updated in real-time, just like Tesla’s digital display. And private security agents monitor alerts from a central hub."
