The fellowship takes place against an ongoing transformation at Eyebeam and builds on Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future, a fast moving initiative created early in the pandemic so that artists could come together and explore the dark frontier of power that commodifies personal information at the expense of democracy and freedom."

This information is public and we welcome all contributions. We aim to include documentation of software and website-based art that has already or risks disappearing due to format obsolescence and the fragile nature of digital media. We also aim to increase access to artists and artworks that have been overlooked by institutions and/or ignored through systemic racism and other forms of social marginalization."

0xSalon page is hosted on/built with the [PubPub Platform](https://www.knowledgefutures.org/pubpub/): "[Open-source](https://github.com/pubpub/platform) technology for creating full-stack knowledge applications for communities of all types."
- "Experiential journals that feel like interactive exhibits. Impact repositories that steward grant proposals from submission to triage to publication. Preprint servers that seamlessly solicit and display structured review. If you can dream it, we can help you build it with PubPub Platform."

[What Theory is *Not*, Theorizing *Is*](https://sci-hub.ru/https://doi.org/10.2307/2393789) (Karl E. Weick, Administrative Science Quarterly, 1995)
<blockquote>Products of the theorizing process seldom emerge as full-blown theories, which means that most of what passes for theory in organizational studies consists of approximations. Although these approximations vary in their generality, few of them take the form of strong theory, and most of them can be read as texts created "in lieu of" strong theories. These substitutes for theory may result from lazy theorizing in which people try to graft theory onto stark sets of data. But they may also represent interim struggles in which people intentionally inch toward stronger theories. The products of laziness and intense struggles may look the same and may consist of references, data, lists, diagrams, and hypotheses. To label these five as "not theory" makes sense if the problem is laziness and incompetence. But ruling out those same five may slow inquiry if the problem is theoretical development still in its early stages. Sutton and Staw know this. But it gets lost in their concern with theory as a product rather than as a process. To add complication and nuance to their message, I want to focus on the process of theorizing.</blockquote>

What do you do if you feel lost in the dark forest of the internet? Knocking on doors is safer than prancing down mainstream but who might be behind the door? The cozyweb is full of sketchy spaces...
Skepticism of those hiding behind academic/art-speak or layers of post-irony that are commonplace
Like the shitty boyfriend who learned the language of emotional intelligence and therapy but uses it to justify the same behavior
"This seems interesting/good" --> "Uh oh, this is bad"
I believe that I am as suceptible to propaganda as anyone
Endlessly forking paths from substacks
