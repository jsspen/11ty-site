I like music, I like lists, I like Bandcamp

Box will be checked once I've listened to the album

Personal thoughts/notes will be added when warranted

[The Best Albums of 2024: A – F](https://daily.bandcamp.com/best-of-2024/the-best-albums-of-2024-a-f)
- [ ] [ÑAÑA | Isleña Antumalen](https://islenaantumalen.bandcamp.com/album/a-a)
    - "Chile has a long history of socio-politically charged music, and this year Mapuche singer and rapper Isleña Antumalen brought prescient stories of environmentalism and decolonization to the dance floor on the kaleidoscopic _ÑAÑA_. Meaning “sister” and “friend” in different Indigenous communities across the Americas, the album title captures the artist’s proud heritage and extends solidarity with water protectors (“KO”) and non-European beauty standards (“Ñaña descoloniza tu belleza”). Bouncing between dembow, reggaetón, cumbia, jazz, and hip-hop, the album’s patchwork of sound is as dazzling and brazen as the artist herself, and as colorful as the Indigenous peoples that continue to thrive on this continent." – Richard Villegas
- [ ] [Slow Burn | Baby Rose (w/ BADBADNOTGOOD)](https://babyrose.bandcamp.com/album/slow-burn)
	- "It’s hard to believe that a couple of the tunes on this record came about at a first meeting between vocalist and band—they ooze the confidence and hooks of a Muscle Shoals classic. “Timeless” is a music descriptor that gets thrown around like a frisbee on a hot day at the beach, but when a deep golden voice—like the one belonging to [Baby Rose](https://babyrose.bandcamp.com/music)—meets the backing of [BADBADNOTGOOD](https://badbadnotgoodofficial.bandcamp.com/album/iv), Toronto’s finest purveyors of jazz-leaning soulful journeys, the outcome rightfully owns the praise." – Andrew Jervis
- [ ] [It’s Inside You | Candy](https://candygonnadie.bandcamp.com/album/it-s-inside-you)
	- "Candy’s third album was conceived in the wake of a collective “Eureka” moment on the part of the Richmond wrecking crew: Given that heavy music is a vehicle for moshing, and moshing is essentially an extreme form of dancing, who’s to say rave music and hardcore punk aren’t two sides of the same coin—musically compatible, even? To be clear, the band’s not dealing in hypotheticals on It’s Inside You, just hard evidence in the form of sick riffs, industrial synths, and brutal drum loops. Standouts like “Dancing to the Infinite Beat” and “Faith 91” bridge the chaos and euphoria of the two undergrounds with such confidence and seamlessness you’d swear the pit and the dancefloor were one and the same. That’s precisely Candy’s point—and the secret to their power." – Zoe Camp
- [ ] [Critterland | Willi Carlisle](https://willicarlislemusic.bandcamp.com/album/critterland)
	- "Now more than ever, we need love. That’s more or less the message behind the music of [Willi Carlisle](https://willicarlislemusic.bandcamp.com/music), a folk singer and songwriter originally from the American Midwest, though he sounds like he’s from another time entirely. On his stunning third album _Critterland_, Carlisle empties his distinctive artistic arsenal—banjo, squeezebox, encyclopedic knowledge of old-time musical styles, even seven minutes of spoken word—and spins deeply moving tales of anguished hearts, broken families, discarded dreams, and, importantly, the beauty and deliverance of a life lived in the presence of love. Now more than ever, we need each other. Now more than ever, we need Willi Carlisle." – Ben Salmon
- [ ] [Still | Erika de Casier](https://erikadecasier.bandcamp.com/album/still)
	- "When 2019’s [_Essentials_](https://erikadecasier.bandcamp.com/album/essentials) appeared on the scene, [Erika de Casier](https://erikadecasier.bandcamp.com/music)’s Y2K-indebted R&B felt novel—a futuristic nostalgia trip that hadn’t yet been cannibalized by the TikTok trend cycle. In 2024, de Casier simply improves on it. On _Still_, the Copenhagen pop star fills in the lines she drew on 2021’s [_Sensational_](https://erikadecasier.bandcamp.com/album/sensational) with an even wider range of club influences to augment her signature digital R&B sound. Laid-back reggaetón beats, skittering drum & bass drum breaks, and Timbaland-esque earworms all lend themselves to de Casier’s sultry, girlish (dare I say coquette-ish) vocals. The embodiment of the Aaliyah lyric “Sometimes I’m goody-goody/ Right now I’m naughty-naughty,” Erika is in her Y2K princess bag and rewriting the blueprint, still." – Stephanie Barclay
- [ ] [Different Type Time | Cavalier](https://cavaliervmc.bandcamp.com/album/different-type-time-2)
	- "After a six-year hiatus, New Orleans-based, Brooklyn-raised emcee [Cavalier](https://cavaliervmc.bandcamp.com/music) returned with _Different Type Time_, his [Backwoodz Studioz](https://backwoodzstudioz.bandcamp.com/) debut and arguable magnum opus. It’s a sprawling record, an hourlong treatise about learning one’s place in the universe. The album’s jazzy sonics smolder like a full ashtray, with thick basslines, warbling keys, and reverberant horns billowing into a pleasant, low-hanging cloud. Cav is a dazzling and curious writer, examining all possible pockets and shapes, twisting words around themselves like he’s solving a Rubik’s cube. Each song feels tactile, translating tiny scraps of memories—he peels a Satsuma orange or sips a Colt 45 on some near-forgotten Brooklyn summer afternoon—into winding, philosophical ruminations." – Dashiell Lewis
- [ ] [The Crystal Hum | Yu Ching](https://huangyuching.bandcamp.com/album/the-crystal-hum)
	- "If A.R. Kane pioneered dream pop by merging cold, dub-influenced spatial explorations with C86 jangle, Taiwanese artist [Yu Ching](https://huangyuching.bandcamp.com/music) brings a warmer, twee approach to her lo-fi, spring-reverb atmospheres on _The Crystal Hum_. Moving back to Taiwan after 11 years in Berlin, Yu Ching delves deeper into the kind of introspective soundscapes she crafts with [Aemong](https://aemong.bandcamp.com/); the result is one of this year’s best bedroom pop records. Her erratic melodies melt into air, guided by bending guitars and simple drum patterns, promising a gentle passage into that good night." – James Gui
- [ ] [elvis, he was Schlager | Church Chords](https://churchchords.bandcamp.com/album/elvis-he-was-schlager)
	- "“Curator” might have become something of a dirty word, but it feels the neatest way to describe Stephen Buono, the impresario at the center of [Church Chords](https://churchchords.bandcamp.com/music). For _elvis, he was Schlager,_ he blended raw performances from a cast of collaborators—Wilco’s [Nels Cline](https://nelsclinetrio.bandcamp.com/album/sad), Tortoise’s [Jeff Parker,](https://intlanthem.bandcamp.com/album/the-new-breed) Thundercat collaborator [Genevieve Artadi](https://genevieveartadi.bandcamp.com/) among them—into ultra-sleek avant-pop. In less able hands, this heady mix of cyborg funk, cosmic jazz fusion, and chanteuse song might collapse into chaos. But Buono’s sensibility—intrepid, exploratory, with an eye on the big picture—maintains a bold and coherent vision throughout." – Louis Pattison
- [x] [Diamond Jubilee | Cindy Lee](https://cindylee.bandcamp.com/album/diamond-jubilee)
	- "A ghostly torch singer, a 1960s girl group diva marooned in time, a funk-disco impresario, a reverb-drenched indie oddity—Patrick Flegel’s seventh and possibly final album as [Cindy Lee](https://cindylee.bandcamp.com/music) teems with artistic personas, taking on a dizzying array of forms over its two-hour-plus length. _Diamond Jubilee_ is so large and so varied that it’s hard to keep the entire album in your head. Yet fragments bubble up to haunt and provoke: The airy croon of “Dallas,” the ebullient pop of “Kingdom Come,” the pop-locking syncopation of “GAYBLEVISION,” the squalling, thundering, falsetto-trilled desolation of “Golden Microphone.” Less an album than a universe, _Diamond Jubilee_ rewards extended exploration." – Jennifer Kelly
- [ ] [ACELERO | Crizin da Z.O. | QTV Selo](https://qtvlabel.bandcamp.com/album/qtv065-acelero)
	- "Samba, _pagodão baiano_, punk, gabber—these are just a few of the tags peppering the liner notes of [Crizin da Z.O](https://meiavida.bandcamp.com/album/alma-braba).’s _ACELERO_. Opening with the pounding force of “O Fim Um”—featuring former Sepultura drummer Igor Cavalera—and culminating with the full-throttle rush of closer “Acelerado,” the third release from the collective (and first for Rio de Janeiro’s [QTV Selo](https://qtvlabel.bandcamp.com/music)) is an industrial funk juggernaut, all Afro-Brazilian rhythms and thick swaths of pummeling noise sewage hurtling forward at thrilling breakneck speed." – Filipe Costa
- [ ] [Nobody Loves You More | Kim Deal](https://kimdeal.bandcamp.com/album/nobody-loves-you-more)
	- "Of course [Kim Deal](https://kimdeal.bandcamp.com/music) made a great solo record—the legendary Deal has never made a bad one. Nevertheless, _Nobody Loves You More_ is a highlight in a flawless discography, a humble collection of odds ‘n’ sods cobbled together with pals from across the indie rock spectrum over the past decade that doesn’t deviate from the vintage Deal sound of guitar-based rock with sweet and sour melodies and lo-fi dissonance—but oh, how sad everything is! As straightforward a record as the enigmatic Deal has ever made, _Nobody Loves You More_ is also rather devastating, assessing with clear-eyed melancholy the existential angst of mortality, regret, and grief—aka: getting old. Sprinklings of trumpets and strings add to the tragically romantic character of these songs, a quality that has never been associated with Deal’s music but, in retrospect, perhaps should have been all along." – Mariana Timony
- [ ] [This Could Be Texas | English Teacher](https://englishteacher.bandcamp.com/album/this-could-be-texas)
	- "Like all good Dadaists, there is a real-world anxiety lurking behind the absurd. In the case of [English Teacher](https://englishteacher.bandcamp.com/music), the Leeds foursome combat a Northerner’s working class malaise with a surrealist’s cheek_._ Tories get the finger on the solemn “Broken Biscuits” (“You can’t stop the banks from bursting/ Blame the council not the rain”) and so do presumptuous racists on the snarling “R&B” (“Despite appearances I haven’t got the voice for R&B/ Even though I’ve seen more COLORS Shows than KEXPs”). Despite being the band’s first outing, _This Could be Texas_ paces itself with preternatural confidence, building tension into enveloping dirges only to cut it loose at the next time signature change—oftentimes all within the same song. This, coupled with the band’s sweeping vistas of sound lends itself to a Texas-sized grandeur that the outfit clearly aspire to. It’s an ambitious first outing and one of the year’s best." – Stephanie Barclay
- [ ] [100% Sahara Guitar | Etran de L'Aïr](https://etrandelair.bandcamp.com/album/100-sahara-guitar)
	- "The Tuareg band [Etran de L’Aïr](https://etrandelair.bandcamp.com/music) began nearly 30 years ago with nothing but an acoustic guitar and a calabash for percussion. They toured relentlessly through their native Niger until they pieced together enough equipment for a full band: Three brothers on electric guitar and bass, accompanied by a family friend on an actual drum set. _100% Sahara Guitar_ is their third album, but the first to be recorded in a proper studio. Don’t call this the [desert blues](https://daily.bandcamp.com/features/ahl-nana-lorchestre-national-mauritanien): Etran de L’Aïr play sun-glazed, psyched-out, blissful music, full of galloping drums, overlapping guitar solos, and chanted vocals. It’s 100% Saharan, 100% celebration, 100% rock ’n’ roll." – Matthew Blackwell
- [ ] [Dance, No One's Watching | Ezra Collective](https://ezracollective.bandcamp.com/album/dance-no-ones-watching)
	- "Sometime during the mid-20th century, jazz turned from a dance genre into “America’s classical music,” creating an unfounded hierarchy of value between music for the concert hall and music for the dancehall. Riding off their 2023 Mercury Prize win, [Ezra Collective](https://ezracollective.bandcamp.com/music) has created a jazz manifesto with _Dance, No One’s Watching_, exposing the false binary between art and dance music, staying true to their roots as a so-called “party band,” while drawing connections between dub, highlife, hip-hop, and abstract jazz that show their virtuosity in full bloom." – James Gui
- [ ] [Trail Of Flowers | Sierra Ferrell](https://sierraferrell.bandcamp.com/album/trail-of-flowers)
	- "The decade-long surge of non-mainstream country artists has been decidedly dude-heavy—it’s Zachs and Jasons and Tylers just about all the way down. How refreshing, then, to experience the steady rise of [Sierra Ferrell](https://sierraferrell.bandcamp.com/music), a distinctive singer, skilled songwriter, and downright ancient soul originally from West Virginia. For years, she has made music that sounds like it should be crackling out of an antique radio: vintage jazz and ragtime, old-time fiddle tunes, rockabilly, blues, murder ballads, the occasional yodel, and so on. _Trail Of Flowers_ offers more of the same, but the songcraft is sharper, the arrangements fuller and the production crisp and crystal clear. It’s a record that just _sounds_ incredible, which only brings out all the colorful charms of Ferrell’s tunes—like precious family heirlooms polished up and properly displayed for all to see." – Ben Salmon
- [ ] [Psalm of Tiamat | Francine Thirteen](https://francinethirteen.bandcamp.com/album/psalm-of-tiamat)
	- "In Babylonian mythology, Tiamat is literally the mother of all gods—the source from which all subsequent divinity sprang. Or, as [Francine Thirteen](https://francinethirteen.bandcamp.com/music) puts it in “Black Maria” from the album that bears the goddess’s name: “Our holy Father/ Was not the first to walk on water.” Consider _Psalm of Tiamat_, then, an alternate spiritual history of humankind—a worship service for those entities sidelined by conventional religious practices. Thirteen is more than up to the task; across seven songs, she casts a riveting, hypnotic spell on tracks that move from haunting, goth-y grandeur to mystic spiritual jazz. Her vocal delivery is the album’s magic talisman; whether it’s the ruminative hum of “Taweret Sobek Re” or the primal thrum of “Tiamat,” Thirteen delivers every line with the poise and authority of a high priestess summoning messages from the beyond. You’d be well advised to heed every single word." – J. Edward Keyes
