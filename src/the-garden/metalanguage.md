# The Metalanguage of the Internet
[The Metalanguage of the Internet](https://lessfoolish.substack.com/p/the-metalanguage-of-the-internet) (Peter Limberg, Less Foolish, 2024/02/22)

## Community-as-Media
- An online community is seen as a trusted source of truth, where truth claims are disseminated, attracting new members.
- Coiners: Carolina Busta and Lil Internet
- From “[Holographic Media](https://outland.art/new-models-holographic-media/)”: To understand what this new era of community as media looks like, imagine the Web 1.0 webforum—multiple nodes arranged in a circle, each equally connected to the others. Now imagine the Web 2.0 attention-driven network: a sea of individual influencers connected unidirectionally to tiers of followers. In a composable community-as-media model, a protocol synthesizes both. Members of a shared network interact in a non-gamified, horizontal way—as in webforums—while also broadcasting across social media feeds, cross-pollinating their community’s thoughts and attracting new members.
## Cozyweb
- Private online spaces that are established and maintained by bespoke protocols.
- Coiner: Venkatesh Rao
- From “[The Extended Internet Universe](https://studio.ribbonfarm.com/p/the-extended-internet-universe)”: Unlike the main public internet, which runs on the (human) protocol of “users” clicking on links on public pages/apps maintained by “publishers”, the cozyweb works on the (human) protocol of everybody cutting-and-pasting bits of text, images, URLs, and screenshots across live streams. Much of this content is poorly addressable, poorly searchable, and very vulnerable to bitrot. It lives in a high-gatekeeping slum-like space comprising slacks, messaging apps, private groups, storage services like dropbox, and of course, email.
## Creator Stadiums
- Places where creators broadcast their content, backed by their supporters.
- Coiners: Arthur Roing Bear and GVN908
- From “[Modular and Portable Multiplayer Miniverses](https://movingcastles.world/modular-and-portable-multiplayer-miniverses)”: Currently, many semi-private communities that rely on crowdfunding to finance their activities also use the public media formats of the creator economy, or Clearnet Stadiums; a vast array of podcasts, private newsletters and video-essays built to highlight individual sensibilities and passions. Creator Stadiums give expression to the thoughts and knowledge of the content-creators that use them to communicate with potential and already existing audiences.
## Dark Forests
- Online gathering spaces that are hidden from public view.
- Coiner: Yancey Strickler (current understanding)
- From “[The Dark Forest Theory Of The Internet](https://ystrickler.com/2019/05/26/2019-the-dark-forest-theory-of-the-internet-1/)”: This is also what the internet is becoming: a dark forest. In response to the ads, the tracking, the trolling, the hype, and other predatory behaviors, we’re retreating to our dark forests of the internet, and away from the mainstream.
## Digital Campfires
- Spaces for conversation and experience emerging within the dark forests.
- Coiner: Sara Wilson
- From “[The Era of Antisocial Social Media](https://hbr.org/2020/02/the-era-of-antisocial-social-media)”: If social media can feel like a crowded airport terminal where everyone is allowed, but no one feels particularly excited to be there, digital campfires offer a more intimate oasis where smaller groups of people are excited to gather around shared interests. I’ve identified three categories of digital campfires: private messaging, micro-communities, and shared experiences. Some digital campfires are a combination of all three.
## Digital Gardens
- A method of arranging information online based on contextual connections for personal navigation.
- Coiner: Maggie Appleton (current understanding)
- From “[A Brief History & Ethos of the Digital Garden](https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history)”: A garden is a collection of evolving ideas that aren't strictly organised by their publication date. They're inherently exploratory – notes are linked through contextual associations. They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.
## Memetic Tribes
- People and bots that act and appear tribal around a memeplex (a meme complex).
- Coiners: Peter Limberg and Conor Barnes
- From “[Memetic Tribes and Culture War 2.0](https://medium.com/s/world-wide-wtf/memetic-tribes-and-culture-war-2-0-14705c43f6bb?sk=9de9000be1d8f57f9f3c05179c47142b)”: We define a memetic tribe as a group of agents with a meme complex, or memeplex, that directly or indirectly seeks to impose its distinct map of reality — along with its moral imperatives — on others. These tribes are on active duty in the new culture war. They possess a multiplicity of competing claims, interests, goals, and organizations. While the red and blue tribes were certainly far from monolithic, any claim to unity between memetic tribes is laughable.”

## Moving Castles
- Online communities with movable “miniverses” (contrasted to “[metaverse](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metaverse)”), agile worlds with their own lores, protocols, and economies.
- Coiners: Arthur Roing Bear and GVN908
- From “[Modular and Portable Multiplayer Miniverses](https://movingcastles.world/modular-and-portable-multiplayer-miniverses)”: A Moving Castle—as popularised by Studio Ghibli’s cult movie “Howl’s Moving Castle”, based on Diana Wynne Jones’ 1986 book of the same title—is a nomadic patchwork of different spaces of mutating and incoherent scale. Such spaces are “bespelled to hold together’’ by the will of their inhabitants, which the Moving Castle can transport to different worlds in times of needs or wish.

## Platform Physics
- The design of a medium dictates how content moves within a network.
- Coiners: Carolina Busta and Lil Internet
- From “[Holographic Media](https://outland.art/new-models-holographic-media/)”: Platform physics are the ways in which a medium’s design determines a piece of content’s nature, the content’s “natural motion” through a network, its recipients’ responses, and the various nth order effects of this content being in circulation.
## Platform Wars
- Social media platforms vie for data and users by impeding content portability across platforms.
- Coiner: Joshua Citarella
- From “[The Platform Wars](https://joshuacitarella.substack.com/p/the-platform-wars)”: All platforms have deployed nearly identical tools: $5 rolling subscriptions, live-streaming, long form posts for premium users, private chats, vertical video shorts, and more. In the short term, platforms will compete on the level of culture (ie which sites have the best offerings for content). In the long term, they will compete on the level of network effects, towards the end goal of establishing an everything-app monopoly. Whether it be Elon Musk’s new X app, Meta, or something else entirely, eventually a quasi-state American analog to WeChat will arise.
## Proof of Vibes
- A security mechanism discerning group membership based on a group's ever-evolving sense of vibes.
- Coiner: Leïth Benkhedda (current understanding)
- From “Proof of Vibes”: In “Squad Wealth,” [Other Internet](https://open.substack.com/users/3432762-other-internet?utm_source=mentions) define vibes as “the ineffable energy that the squad values most” and “an unstable substance of high information density.” Online communities, very much like their IRL counterpart, do operate on “vibes.” Vibes always be shifting, and for those who do not live in the pod and do not eat the bugs, virtual community lore moves much faster than one can keep track of.
- So not associated with whatever this is [Proof of Vibes](https://www.proofofvibes.com/)
## Protocol Pill
- To bring awareness to the importance of having protocol literacy.
- Coiner: [Summer of Protocols](https://summerofprotocols.com/)
- From “[The Unreasonable Sufficiency of Protocols](https://venkatesh-rao.gitbook.io/summer-of-protocols/)”: A protocol is a relatively simple and codified set of behaviors that, when adopted by a sufficient number of participants (human and/or artificial) in a situation, reliably leads to good-enough outcomes for all.
## Second Self
- One’s digital persona across the internet, consciously or unconsciously shaped by an individual, audience, or memetic tribe.
- Coiner: Sherry Turkle
- From [The Second Self: Computers and the Human Spirit](https://www.amazon.com/Second-Self-Computers-Human-Spirit/dp/0671468480): Further, the psychological holding power of the computer is no longer limited to one-on-one person/machine interaction. Millions of people now interact with one another via computers on networks, where they have the opportunity to talk, to exchange ideas and feelings, and to assume personae of their own creation
