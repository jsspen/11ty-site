# Organized Abandonment

<blockquote>"Denying someone insurance isn't violence. Giving someone diabetes through the omnipresence of corn syrup isn't violence. Paying people a shitty wage isn't violence.  Here's a list of things that are violence: Violence, as in actually using force to injure, maim, or kill another. That's it."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ruth Wilson Gilmore's concept of "organized abandonment" is useful here: the intentional disinvestment and neglect which creates group-level vulnerability to premature death. Organized abandonment kills more people than interpersonal violence, and it's not even close. It's worse.

(That being said, many deaths attributable to interpersonal violence can also be attributed to organized abandonment â€” gun violence is most prevalent in some of the poorest, most segregated neighborhoods in America)"</blockquote>
