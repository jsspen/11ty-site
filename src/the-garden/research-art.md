# Research-based Art/ists, Networks, Digital Spaces

## [Do Not Research](https://donotresearch.substack.com/)
Founded by Joshua Citarella


## [0xSalon](https://0xsalon.pubpub.org/)
an event/discussion series around art/tech
- dense channel on [Are.na](https://www.are.na/0x-salon/channels)
- follow [Chatham House Rule](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chatham_House_Rule): "anyone who comes to a meeting is free to use information from the discussion, but is not allowed to reveal who made any particular comment"

2024 0xSalon residents:
- [Alessandro Y. Longo](https://reincantamento.xyz/), a Berlin-based writer/researcher
  - "research is channeled through the collective body of [REINCANTAMENTO]((https://reincantamento.xyz/)), an independent collective of researchers, philosophers, and designers exploring the entanglement between technology and magic."
- [Sammie Veeler](https://veeler.biz/), an LA-based artist
  - founder of [New Art City](https://newart.city/) a "virtual gallery & exhibition toolkit for digital art" and the Virtual Access Lab "non-profit research unit" within it (in collaboration with [Gray Area](https://grayarea.org/), a San Francisco-based nonprofit cultural incubator)
    - It seems the Virtual Access Lab is an ongoing project to research and test the infrastructure of New Art City for better accessibility in collaboration with an "Accessibility Panel"
      - panelist [Andy Slater](https://www.thisisandyslater.net/), "a blind Chicago-based media artist, writer, performer, and disability advocate/loudmouth"
        - the phonology of the blind body, spatial audio for extended reality, digital scent design
  - a current incubator member at [New Inc.](https://www.newmuseum.org/new-inc/meet-newinc/) (a "museum-led cultural incubator" from the New Museum) in the "Y10 Extended Realities track" (can't find any info on what exactly that is...)
  - a 2024 [Eyebeam Democracy Machine](https://eyebeam.org/program/the-democracy-machine/) fellow.
    - "*The Democracy Machine* is our radical experiment created to unlock artist-led invention in the areas of self-governance, technology, and democracy. The fellowship takes place against an ongoing transformation at Eyebeam and builds on Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future, a fast moving initiative created early in the pandemic so that artists could come together and explore the dark frontier of power that commodifies personal information at the expense of democracy and freedom."
  - has received project support from [Mirror](https://mirrorarchive.net/), an artist-focused public archive, part of the [UCLA Arts Software Studio](https://github.com/uclaconditional)
    - led by Casey Reas, Lauren Lee McCarthy, and Chandler McWilliams
    - "Our goal is to collect and store documentation of artists and artworks from the widest possible social, cultural, and geographic areas. This information is public and we welcome all contributions. We aim to include documentation of software and website-based art that has already or risks disappearing due to format obsolescence and the fragile nature of digital media. We also aim to increase access to artists and artworks that have been overlooked by institutions and/or ignored through systemic racism and other forms of social marginalization."

0xSalon page is hosted on/built with the [PubPub Platform](https://www.knowledgefutures.org/pubpub/): "[Open-source](https://github.com/pubpub/platform) technology for creating full-stack knowledge applications for communities of all types."
- "Experiential journals that feel like interactive exhibits. Impact repositories that steward grant proposals from submission to triage to publication. Preprint servers that seamlessly solicit and display structured review. If you can dream it, we can help you build it with PubPub Platform."
