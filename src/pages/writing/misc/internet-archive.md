# Internet History
2024-11-13

The importance of the Internet Archive cannot be overstated and it has been difficult to watch them struggle this last month.

You expect people to go after big business and companies with high-dollar-value data, not a library.

"The internet is forever" has been repeated for a long time. While the intended message &mdash; to encourage caution in what we do or say or upload to the internet &mdash; is an important message I think it has also had a side-effect in how we view the internet and "history." It takes a lot of work to preserve things and data is no different. Technologies change over time. Just try to play a realmedia file today!

It's a problem that has affected the art world for a while now. How to preserve a work of art, and continue to actually <i>show it</i>, as the technology it relies on slips into the past. One example that jumps to mind is the flourescent light sculptures of Dan Flavin, made with tubes that are no longer produced and for which no LED could ever suffice. I've heard the Dia Art Foundation have hoarded a nice supply to keep them glowing as long as possible but once they've all burned out...

Preservation requires constant upkeep and the pieces of digital-born history that are being preserved are still very fragile. It's easy to forget but the internet is just a bunch of cables running around along the bottom of the ocean (see: Trevor Paglen's <a href="https://paglen.studio/2020/05/22/undersea-cables/">photo series</a>). The Library of Alexandria could still be burned today, even if everything was stored on hard-drives and backed up to the cloud.

Years ago I attended a talk by Kenneth Goldsmith and something he said has stuck with me: "If you love something, download it!"
