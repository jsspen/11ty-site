# Internet History

The importance of the Internet Archive cannot be overstated and it has been difficult to watch them struggle this last month.

You expect people to go after big business and companies with high-dollar-value data, not a library.

"The internet is forever" has been repeated for a long time. While the intended message - to encourage caution in what we do or say or upload to the internet - is an important message I think it has also had a side-effect in how we view the internet and "history." It takes a lot of work to preserve things and data is no different. Technologies change over time.

The history that is actually being preserved is still fragile. It's easy to forget but the internet is just a bunch of cables running around the world. The Library of Alexandria could still be burned today, even if everything was stored on hard-drives and backed up to the cloud.

Also, to quote Kenneth Goldsmith: "If you love something, download it!"
