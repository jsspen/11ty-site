# On LinkedIn "Top Applicant" Bait
<div class="post-date">2024-12-13</div>

**First:** I am not a data scientist and this is not an orchestrated study! 

I am a software developer who was laid off so I have been spending hours on LinkedIn applying for jobs. I started to notice some things that didn't really make sense to me, so I started keeping some side-notes as I went along. I definitely don't claim to have any answers! I'm just trying to make sense of it all. Plus, by the time I started writing this my LinkedIn Premium benefits had ended (surprise: I cancelled it), so I also can't really dig back into any of this or update/expand on the data.

## Premium Bait

One of the selling points of LinkedIn Premium is something on the [plan matrix](https://www.linkedin.com/help/linkedin/answer/a545596/linkedin-free-accounts-and-premium-subscriptions?lang=en) that they call "Top choice job." This is a new tab on your jobs page labeled "Top Applicant" that LinkedIn describes as "jobs where you’d be a top applicant, based on your chances of hearing back." It's pretty vague language but anything that could potentially help you sift through the junk sounds good when you're unemployed and staring down the thousands of jobs posted to the platform daily.

### What does it mean to be a "Top Applicant" in LinkedIn's eyes?

"LinkedIn Premium members can use the Top Applicant feature to enhance their job search. This feature helps job searchers identify and apply for jobs where they’re considered a top candidate based on their profile information, the job posting criteria, and recruiter feedback on previous applicants to similar jobs. The feature only displays if you’re in the top 50% of applicants for at least one role. This will be determined by the current members who’ve applied for the role and requires at least 10 applicants."

### What does it mean in practice?

I of course would regularly check this tab and apply for any position for which I was qualified. I quickly noticed that these "picks" seemed pretty indistinguishable from the results I would get by just searching for "software engineer." For 3 days I wrote down some info on what I was seeing on the first two pages of my "Top Applicant" picks. I must have accidentally deleted or copied over an entry so I'm annoyingly stuck with 59 posts instead of the nice round 60 I should have had. 

Anyway, of the 59 positions...
- 12 were marked as reposts
- 49 were "promoted" posts
- 29 were already over 1,000 applicants
- 13 were already over 2,000 applicants

My favorite match was when LinkedIn served me an opening at GitHub for a Software Engineer. This is a job I am qualified for (supposedly, more on that later) but at the time of serving it to me on the first page of my matches...
- It was a repost from 3 days ago
- In the last 24 hours it had gained 1,453 new applicants
- In the x number of times is had been reposted it had amassed a total of 10,631 applicants
- It was clearly marked "applied" because yes, LinkedIn knew that *I had already applied for this position days before*

LinkedIn knew I had applied to that job because after I had clicked through the post and applied, I had returned to LinkedIn and confirmed in the pop-up "Yes, I applied for this position." LinkedIn want to know whether you just clicked through or if you actually applied. They say it's so they can help me keep track of my application. Using that info to *not serve me positions I've already applied for* seems like a pretty use if you're actually trying to improve customer experience but... oh well.

### Skills Matching

On occasion LinkedIn would show a little "skills match" module on the post. 13 of the 59 positions I saved had this info available for me. To be clear, I have spent time individually entering skills into my profile and in fact I'm pretty sure I'm actually at the maximum allowed number of skill entries. So here are the 13 skill matches from jobs LinkedIn served me to me as "Top Applicant" picks:

- 0 of 1 skills match (0%)
- 0 of 1 skills match (0%)
- 0 of 4 skills match (0%)
- 1 of 2 skills match (50%)
- 1 of 3 skills match (33.33%)
- 1 of 11 skills match (9.09%)
- 2 of 9 skills match (22.22%)
- 2 of 10 skills match (20%)
- 3 of 5 skills match (60%)
- 3 of 8 skills match (37.5%)
- 4 of 10 skills match (40%)
- 5 of 10 skills match (50%)
- 5 of 11 skills match (45.45%)

Setting aside the (*three!*) 0% "matches" here, LinkedIn is telling me I'm somehow a "Top Applicant" for a job where I have literally 1 of the 11 skills the company wants? My best bet here is a 3/5? Why would they suggest these?

Well, remember when I mentioned that 49 out of the 59 posts I'm looking at were paid promos? Would you believe that 100% of these skill match pairings were promoted posts? It seems like LinkedIn would rather show a promoted post than a good match.

So I'm paying $40/mo to LinkedIn for them to show me jobs where I'll supposedly stand the best chance of being hired, but nearly every one of those matches I'm served is a paid promo, which is obviously going to have a huge number of applicants already, and even if I do happen to catch the job right when it's posted it's entirely possible that I'm not even a good match skills-wise because even though LinkedIn has a "skills" system in place it doesn't seem like it's actually being used when picking these "matches" to serve to you.

I wish I would have cancelled sooner.
