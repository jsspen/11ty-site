# Exhibition 3
<span class="semibold">24 Sealed Pistachios</span><br>
January 10&mdash;January 17, 2020<br>
Handout PDF (temporarily unavailable)

<i>24 Sealed Pistachios</i> was presented in collaboration with guest curator by Tyler Cann. 24 sealed pistachios were arranged in the gallery and a handout informed visitors that if they could open the nut, it was theirs to take. Of the 24, 9 were opened. In addition to hands, visitors used a pair of pliers, a shoe, and a brick, to open the nuts. On the night of January 16th or the early morning of January 17th the remaining nuts and the opened shells were discarded by a member of the office cleaning crew, bringing the exhibition to a premature (but fitting) end.
