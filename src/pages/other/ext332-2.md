This exhibition displayed an editioned invitation produced by New Yorkâ€™s Ubu gallery for a Yoko Ono show in 1995. The invitation had been found a few months prior in a drawer in the office where Ext. 332 is currently housed. The paper invitation meant to accompany the edition was missing, so it is assumed that whoever received this attended the exhibition.

A free 4x6" postcard was produced in connection with this exhibition. Limited copies remain and are available upon request.
