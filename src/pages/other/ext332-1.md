The inaugural exhibition at Ext. 332 was the display of a poster for a gallery exhibition running almost concurrently in London. The details of the “real” exhibition were placed facing the table, leaving only the collaged advertisement to view without context. The details of the London show could only be found by reading the title of the Ext. 332 show.
