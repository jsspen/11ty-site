<blockquote>"Denying someone insurance isn't violence. Giving someone diabetes through the omnipresence of corn syrup isn't violence. Paying people a shitty wage isn't violence.  Here's a list of things that are violence: Violence, as in actually using force to injure, maim, or kill another. That's it."</blockquote>

<blockquote>"Ruth Wilson Gilmore's concept of "organized abandonment" is useful here: the intentional disinvestment and neglect which creates group-level vulnerability to premature death. Organized abandonment kills more people than interpersonal violence, and it's not even close. It's worse.
<p>(That being said, many deaths attributable to interpersonal violence can also be attributed to organized abandonment â€” gun violence is most prevalent in some of the poorest, most segregated neighborhoods in America)&quot;</blockquote></p>
