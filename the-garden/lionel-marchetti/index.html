<h3>Lionel Marchetti, 2016</h3>
<p>A gigantic dragon whose head and tail are invisible, <em>ATLAS (97 phenomena…)</em> is a collection that slowly unfolds following a meandering path through several dozen concrete compositions.</p>
<p>Multiplying the poetics, the invoices, the styles, the eras, the origins (experiments on the art of recorded sound, improvisations reformulated for acousmatic listening, music for radiophonic creation, cinema, installation, theater and other new electroacoustic compositions) the whole is put to sound in a grand final gesture, like a monumental sound labyrinth where the listener is offered to get lost, definitively... or, for the one who will emerge - possibly transformed - to find himself face to face with that which, through the veil of multipicity, will never be able to be named.</p>
<p>In the works for many years, emerging, without my knowledge, from the meticulous search of my analog and digital musical archives in order, little by little, to exhume (to bring out) more than a number - scattered pieces caught in the net of the forge of the great work over almost thirty years: objects, entities, characters, fictions of spaces, rocks, winds, water and fire, breath, voices, colors, tastes, cries, bodies, numerous materials loaded with their poetics and invoices of then and to come, sometimes divergent and left fallow in the boxes of the sound workshop...</p>
<p>...all slowly organized and today proposed in one go, in an immense roll that is not without recalling that of the calligrapher: horizontal deployment intended for the cavalier vision in order to fly over the entirety of a territory.</p>
<p>A number, in the sense, also, of the search for a unity.</p>
<p>Because it is now a question, with the arrangement and composition of these multiple phenomena, of letting emerge, of letting rise a line of force - a vein, with a geomorphological appearance - and precisely, these are eras, structures, materials and impulses variously shaped, sometimes heterogeneous, which have all been challenged to coexist: in the same surge, in a long drift, for a blossoming, &quot;like a tower that would grow from its own substance&quot; (Roberto Juarroz).</p>
<p>Creation of a vast complex, therefore, in the full sense of the word, that is to say offering this possibility, for the listener, that a natural force spawns in these parts, and this, so that he feels it - fully.</p>
<p>Is it a trap?</p>
<p>Is it a net thrown into an ocean of sounds?</p>
<p>What are we going to grasp, discover or understand here, listening?</p>
<p>Will it be possible to come back?</p>
<p>Is it a closed space or an open space?</p>
<p>Isn't there, rather, a path, to which we should, here and there, and according to a measure specific to each, tune our breathing, in order to finally escape and finally find a singular existence?</p>
<p>The challenge for me, with so much material in hand, was therefore to play with the alternation of concrete compositions that were very tight in their writing, mixing poetics that were sometimes distant, with an aphoristic allure, sometimes firmly folded in on themselves and that had to find their breath by confronting (responding) to absolutely other views, stretched, plastic, large, smooth, while juggling through different styles within the concrete musical genre itself: field recordings, sounds of the world, animalities, anecdotal, abstractions, games with the fantastic, captured sound phenomena, small sound theaters, acousmatic fictions (most often) or even documentary-style recordings…</p>
<p>We will evolve, for example, from the sound recording of a space traveler's diary to the acoustic discovery of more or less objectively observed places (a campsite in Japan under Mount Fuji, a nocturnal square in Italy, a torrent in the Alps, a lake in China, a recording of the waves of the Pacific Ocean...) as well as through the raw reality of sound phenomena captured and reworked as such, as close as possible to the materiality of the loudspeaker membrane, in order to obtain, finally, a properly physical synthetic flavor; we will find ourselves abandoned to many fictions both microscopic and macroscopic, on the edge of the abstract and the concrete, jostling and playing, knowingly, with all the scales, the internal spaces specific to loudspeaker writing, the presence or absence of vocal characters and their avatars, all drifting slowly and at length within the deployment, in a compass rose, of multiple paradoxical cartographies, folded, unfolded, folded... as the infinite manipulation of recorded sounds knows how to offer us.</p>
<p>A crossing of waves and poetics, all associated with an idea of ​​musical study.</p>
<p>We will also be accompanied, throughout the work, by an improbable recorded sound couple: two vocoid robot machines (Robinson &amp; Virginia) - the texts, in English, are written by the philosopher Frédéric Neyrat - whose questions, remarks, intimate relationship, points of view will direct our listening and will be the signature of a great journey: from the world of the human, both actor and observer, through the machine (intelligent?) to the Cosmos.</p>
<p>In the same vein, all the compositions, organized into seven Circles, will be highlighted, here and there, by a few original thoughts (recorded and set to sound) by the same philosopher Frédéric Neyrat who - from his eagle's eye view, from his wandering star's path, as an off-screen character - will appear from time to time in the cosmological sky of the work to open us up to its symbolic, metaphorical and metaphysical dimension all at once, unless it is to bring us back, by a fundamentally different path, after twists and turns, to the enigmatic essence of the things that populate the universe.

<h3>Michèle Tosi, ResMusica, September 2017</h3>
<p>During the creation of the full version on Acousmonium Motus at the Futura Festival 2017 by Nathanaëlle Raboisson, Olivier Lamarche, Eric Broitmann, Paul Ramage, Guillaume Contré and Lionel Marchetti.</p>
<h4>A World Work</h4>
<p>The idea of ​​giving <em>Atlas (97 phenomena)</em> continuously crossed the mind of the composer who worked for some ten years on this demiurgic enterprise, without constraint or limitation of any kind, with, at the heart of the project, the utopia of embracing all the sounds of the world. For Lionel Marchetti, it was a question of bringing together the sum of materials stored in his archives — samples, scraps, scattered sound objects — which he had never used, and of creating an assembly without any a priori concern for form. The idea of ​​the collection (an atlas) and its different chapters (seven “circles” and 97 phenomena) was then born, to which the composer would give titles, imagining, beyond this classification and through a few transitions, a sort of scenario: the journal of a traveler in space (Circles I and II) who returns to earth and apprehends the physical world (forests, deserts, oceans, clouds, rivers, mountains, etc.), even initiating a metaphysical reflection (reading the Book of Job). Three voices, treated in different ways, guide our listening and create a link in this initiatory journey: that of the professor – the philosopher Frédéric Neyrat – and of two robots speaking in English. About ten performers – including the composer – take turns at the projection console to create a space, via the orchestra of loudspeakers (acousmonium Motus), this world work in which we let ourselves be immersed: &quot;a crossing of waves and poetics, all associated with the idea of ​​musical study&quot; the composer rightly specifies.</p>
<hr>
<h3>Lionel Marchetti, 2018</h3>
<p>Composition — pure madness</p>
<p>Open labyrinth but also entanglements, paths upon paths, imbroglio</p>
<p>Ever-increasing complexity of connections, disconnections, sequences and relationships</p>
<p>Appearances, abundances, intensities and inventions (a host of inventions)</p>
<p>Microphonic wanderings and multiplication of motifs: reality is the motif</p>
<p>River, springs, streams, forests, caverns, mountains and coastlines</p>
<p>Curves of the Earth seen from above</p>
<p>Matériologies, reliefs, a whole catalogue of substances, morphologies and waves</p>
<p>But also, why not, and we will have to put an end to this once and for all: human city, electricity, dark psychologies and fictions (dangerous and proliferating multiplication of the little mental theatre)</p>
<p>The exercise of the trap</p>
<p>Sum or collection?</p>
<p>Meditation and action</p>
<p>A voice manifests itself, an incision in the body of sound</p>
<p>Several voices, an archaeology of the voice, unless it is the presence of fire</p>
<p>For each burst, a word and soon, who knows, the arrival of a word</p>
<p>A fire that burns because of the wood, burns only if there is a supply (of fuel), but it dies in that very place, if there is no more supply, because then the condition has changed</p>
<p>The game of the world</p>
<p>The flow</p>
<p>Space, spacings, circulation of forces in the very body of matter and time</p>
<p>The risk of necessary questions</p>
<p>What is a phenomenon: the appearance, the observed arrival of what is there, waiting or the search for a breath, a circulation between emergences now present?</p>
<p>Does silence exist?</p>
<p>The ebb and flow</p>
<p>Stars, starry sky, vertical affirmation, here and there, of the void</p>
<p>Cosmos</p>
<p>How is it possible to combine so many diversely located spaces?</p>
<p>The path up and down is one and the same</p>
<p>Do not lie to yourself</p>
<p>The mountain is still</p>
<p>Abandon all stratagems</p>
<p>The sword</p>
<p>The return to oneself — for a new beginning</p>
<p>The eye and the ear</p>
<p>Atlas —</p>
<p>A labyrinthine suite with a more or less archaic style where the local, at each twist and turn, is reflected in the global amplifying the chaotic evidence of a spiral shape</p>
<p>The helicoid already there since dawn and its first breath.

<h4>New to Me</h4>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_von_Neumann">John von Neumann</a> (1903-1957): Hungarian and American mathematician, physicist, computer scientist, and engineer.</p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robinson_Jeffers">Robinson Jeffers</a> (1887-1962): American poet known for his work about the central California coast. &quot;Influential and highly regarded in some circles, despite or because of his philosophy of &quot;inhumanism&quot;, Jeffers believed that transcending conflict required human concerns to be de-emphasized in favor of the boundless whole. This led him to oppose U.S. participation in World War II, a stance that was controversial after the U.S. entered the war.&quot;</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Inhumanism</strong>: Jeffers coined the word &quot;inhumanism&quot;: the belief that humankind is too self-centered and indifferent to the &quot;astonishing beauty of things.&quot; In the poem &quot;Carmel Point&quot; Jeffers called on humans to &quot;uncenter&quot; themselves. In &quot;The Double Axe&quot; Jeffers explicitly described &quot;inhumanism&quot; as &quot;a shifting of emphasis and significance from man to 'notman'; the rejection of human solipsism, and recognition of the trans-human magnificence... This manner of thought and feeling is neither misanthropic nor pessimist... It offers a reasonable detachment as rule of conduct, instead of love, hate and envy... it provides magnificence for the religious instinct, and satisfies our need to admire greatness and rejoice in beauty.&quot;</li>

<p><a href="https://music.metason.net/artistinfo?name=Dominique%20R%C3%A9p%C3%A9caud">Dominique Répécaud</a> (1955-2016): French guitarist &quot;known as much for his participation to free-rock groups <em>Soixante Étages</em> and <em>Étage 34</em> as for his involvement in the influential avant-garde music festival <em>Musique Action in Vandoeuvre-les-Nancy</em> (France). His career consists of short episodes of public activity interspersed with long periods of listening, writing (in <em>Revue &amp; Corrigée</em>, although under a nom de plume), and running the independent label 33revpermi. If his guitar playing (loud, raucous, free-form but definitely rooted in rock like Thurston Moore) has inspired a few followers, he has a bigger impact as an advocate of creative music.&quot; <a href="https://www.allmusic.com/artist/dominique-r%C3%A9p%C3%A9caud-mn0001831686#biography">#</a></p>
<p><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Giuseppe_Ungaretti">Giuseppe Ungaretti</a> (1888-1970): Italian poet, journalist, essayist, critic, and academic.</p>
<ul>
<li>A leading representative of the experimental trend known as Ermetismo (&quot;<a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hermeticism_(poetry)">Hermeticism</a>&quot;), he was one of the most prominent contributors to 20th century Italian literature. Influenced by symbolism, he was briefly aligned with futurism. Like many futurists, he took an <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Italia_irredenta">irredentist</a> position during World War I. Ungaretti debuted as a poet while fighting in the trenches, publishing one of his best-known pieces, L'allegria (&quot;The Joy&quot;).</li>
<li>Two of Ungaretti's poems (&quot;Soldiers – War – Another War&quot; and &quot;Vanity&quot;) were made into song by American composer Harry Partch (Eleven Intrusions, 1949–50).</li>
<li>Eleven of his poems were set by the French-Romanian composer Horațiu Rădulescu in his cycle <em>End of Kronos</em> (1999).</li>
<li>Fragments of his poetry are set by composer Michael Mantler in <em>Cerco un Paese Innocente</em>, a work recorded in 1994.</li>
<li>Austrian-Hungarian composer Iván Eröd used his poems in four of his works: &quot;<em>Tutto ho perduto</em>&quot; Op. 12 (1965), &quot;<em>Canti di Ungaretti</em>&quot; Op. 55 (1988), &quot;<em>Vox lucis</em>&quot; Op. 56 (1988–89) and in his last work &quot;<em>Canti di un Ottantenne</em>&quot; Op. 95 (2019), completed only several days before his death in June 2019.</li>
