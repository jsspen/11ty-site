<ul>
<li>&quot;research is channeled through the collective body of <a href="(https://reincantamento.xyz/)">REINCANTAMENTO</a>, an independent collective of researchers, philosophers, and designers exploring the entanglement between technology and magic.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li><a href="https://veeler.biz/">Sammie Veeler</a>, an LA-based artist
<ul>
<li>founder of <a href="https://newart.city/">New Art City</a> a &quot;virtual gallery &amp; exhibition toolkit for digital art&quot; and the Virtual Access Lab &quot;non-profit research unit&quot; within it (in collaboration with <a href="https://grayarea.org/">Gray Area</a>, a San Francisco-based nonprofit cultural incubator)
<ul>
<li>It seems the Virtual Access Lab is an ongoing project to research and test the infrastructure of New Art City for better accessibility in collaboration with an &quot;Accessibility Panel&quot;

<li>a 2024 <a href="https://eyebeam.org/program/the-democracy-machine/">Eyebeam Democracy Machine</a> fellow.
<ul>
<li>&quot;<em>The Democracy Machine</em> is our radical experiment created to unlock artist-led invention in the areas of self-governance, technology, and democracy. The fellowship takes place against an ongoing transformation at Eyebeam and builds on Rapid Response for a Better Digital Future, a fast moving initiative created early in the pandemic so that artists could come together and explore the dark frontier of power that commodifies personal information at the expense of democracy and freedom.&quot;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>has received project support from <a href="https://mirrorarchive.net/">Mirror</a>, an artist-focused public archive, part of the <a href="https://github.com/uclaconditional">UCLA Arts Software Studio</a>
<ul>
<li>led by Casey Reas, Lauren Lee McCarthy, and Chandler McWilliams</li>
<li>&quot;Our goal is to collect and store documentation of artists and artworks from the widest possible social, cultural, and geographic areas. This information is public and we welcome all contributions. We aim to include documentation of software and website-based art that has already or risks disappearing due to format obsolescence and the fragile nature of digital media. We also aim to increase access to artists and artworks that have been overlooked by institutions and/or ignored through systemic racism and other forms of social marginalization.&quot;</li>
